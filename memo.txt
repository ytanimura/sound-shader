The json settings specified in this command will be treated as the basic settings.
If other arguments are specified for shaders, resources, or output, the settings will be overridden at runtime.
For example, if only a different shader is specified in the other arguments, the result will be output to the destination specified here.
If no arguments are specified, default.json will be loaded, but if other arguments are specified, they will be ignored;
if you want to use default.json as the default setting, you must load it explicitly with this command.
